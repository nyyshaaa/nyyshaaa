# Hi there 👋 

- 🔭 I’m currently learning and experimenting with **back-end software engineering** for optimizations, analytics ,performance tuning and scalability.
- 🌱 Back-end Engineering Experience via hands on learning — 7.5 months (November 2024 - August end 2025) + ongoing.
- 💡 Passionate about building **efficient, reliable, and secure systems** — with a keen eye on optimizations, observability, and clean architecture.
- 💼 Actively seeking **Back-End Engineer**, **Python Developer**, or **Software Engineer** roles.
- 🛠️ Previous experience in:
  - 🖥️ **Frontend Engineering** 5 months(2022) — built and deployed interactive UIs.
  - 🤖 **Machine Learning** 4 months(Part-time, 2024) — *explored* computer vision,state of art cnn architechtures,improved image gradients to enhance classification metrics, model building,model training.
