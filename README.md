# Hi there 👋 

- 💡 Backend-focused engineer with hands-on experience building **clean, optimised ,secure & reliable backend systems from the ground up**.

- 💡 I enjoy thinking critically and deeply about system design, data modeling, correctness, easier long-term scalability and maintainability .

🌱 Designed an **end-to-end backend system** with a correctness-first approach, focusing on data integrity, security, and intentional data modeling to achieve query efficiency and performance optimizations at the architectural level.

- 🌱 Back-end Engineering Experience via hands on learning — 9.5 months (November 2024 - December end 2025) + ongoing(on pause from feb 2026).
- 💼 Actively seeking **Back-End Engineer**, **Python Developer**, or **Software Engineer** roles.
  
- 🛠️ Previous experience in:
  - 🖥️ **Frontend Engineering** 4 months — built and deployed interactive UIs.
  - 🤖 **Machine Learning** 4 months(Part-time, 2024) — *explored* computer vision,state of art cnn architechtures,improved image gradients to improve model predictions and classification metrics .
 
**On pause from February 2026 as not getting replies at all for backend internships & backend full times & even relevant roles .  Working for govt exams for this year . I guess it cannot work without college degrees and recommendations or it will take lots of time like years. I will start with a different path as first start, start building strength again , do possible movement activities and keep improving and hopefully later in approx 8-10 years do bioelectricity plus prosthetics , restart parkour again , start running again and do lots of other forms of intense and long duration athletics**

### 🔹 2024 Nov – 2025 December end (9.5 months) + ongoing — Back-End Engineering

####  🌱 Core Projects

- **Phyllonix(FastAPI,Relational DB with necessary JSON fileds,SQLAlchemy ORM)**
   An ecommerce app for healthy snacks,arts stuff ...
  [🔗 GitHub Link](https://github.com/nyyshaaa/phyllonix)
  
  A backend service with concurrency and retry -safe APIs and database operations, idempotent payment workflows with webhooks, scalable database design, caching and rate-limiting strategies,retries and circuit breaker implementation,
   secure authentication and authorization & device check flows,cursor-based pagination for product pages, and comprehensive integration tests, api and db deployment,efficient error handling and clean logging,
   eventually consistent queue and worker system(in memory for now) & can be integrated with durable pubsub system with low effort refactors. 
  
- **URL Shortener (FastAPI,SQLAlchemy)**  
  A url shortener API to shorten urls (API key authentication and authorization ,basic analytics , midlewares ,caching, unit and integration testing , api response times analysis , benchmarking, 
  monitoring+observability, circuit breaker , API versioning)
